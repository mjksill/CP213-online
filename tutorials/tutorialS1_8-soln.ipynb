    "### Formulating the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off this problem, we first try understand what is physically going on in the system.  The air in the bottle is pressurized.  When the opening at the bottom of the bottle is cleared, water will start to jet out due to the pressure difference between the air inside the bottle and the outside air pressure.  As the water exits the bottle, the volume the air occupies within the bottle will increase, and, as a result, the air pressure in the bottle will decrease.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we try to enumerate the unknown quantities that we need to solve for.  The first is the mass flowrate $\\dot{m}$ of water from the bottle.  To determine this, we will need to know the pressure $p$ of the air (and water) in the bottle.  This pressure will be determined from the initial conditions of the system and the volume $V$ of the air space in the bottle.  So in all, we have three main unknowns: $\\dot{m}$, $p$, and $V$.  In order to solve for these three unknowns, we need three equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation is the relationship between the air pressure in the bottle and the volume of the air space\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $p_1=2\\,{\\rm barg}=3\\,{\\rm bara}$ is the initial pressure in the bottle, and $V_1$ is the initial volume of air in the bottle, which will depend on the amount of water we initially fill the bottle with.  This equation allows us to write $p(t)$ in terms of $V(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second equation is the valve equation, which relates the velocity at which the water exits the bottle to the pressure difference across the nozzle\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  v = K\\sqrt{2\\Delta p/\\rho}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "\\\\\n",
    "&= \\rho A_0 K\\sqrt{2(p(t)-p_0)/\\rho}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "  y &= \\frac{p_0V(t)}{p_1V_1} = \\frac{p_0}{p(t)}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "This gives us some expectations of the range of values that the\n",
    "variable $y$ can have.  We know that initially the pressure in the\n",
    "bottle rocket must be greater than the atmospheric pressure.  This\n",
    "means that the initial value of $y$ should be less than one.  As water\n",
    "is ejected from the rocket, the pressure should gradually decrease,\n",
    "which implies that $y$ will increase.  The lowest value of $p$ should\n",
    "be the atmospheric pressure $p_0$; in this case, $y=1$.  So we expect\n",
    "that $y$ should start as a number less than $1$ and monotonically\n",
    "increase to a value of $1$ as time progresses.  However, if there is insufficient water in the bottle, then the bottle may become empty of water before the air pressure reaches atmospheric pressure; in this case, the solution will stop before $y$ reaches $1$.\n",
