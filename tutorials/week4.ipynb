    "$\\dot{W}=410\\,{\\rm hp}$ engine and mass of $m=1450\\,{\\rm kg}$.  The\n",
    "force $F_e$ that propels the car forward is provided by the engine,\n",
    "and the magnitude of that force is directly related to the power it\n",
    "supplies.  Recall that when a force acts over a distance, it performs\n",
    "work.  That is, if a force ${\\bf F}$ acts over a small displacement\n",
    "$d{\\bf x}$, then the work performed $dW$ is\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\label{eq:work}\n",
    "dW = {\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf x}\n",
    ".\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Remember that power is the rate at which work is performed; that is,\n",
    "it is the work per unit time.  By dividing both sides of\n",
    "the above equation by the interval of time $dt$ over which the\n",
    "displacement occurred, we find:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{dW}{dt} = {\\bf F}\\cdot \\frac{d{\\bf x}}{dt}\n",
    ".\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Using the fact that displacement per unit time is just the velocity,\n",

    "\\label{eq:power}\n",
    "\\dot{W} = {\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf v}\n",
    ".\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "So, power (or the rate at which work is performed) is equal to the\n",

    "%  C_d &= \\frac{F_d/A}{\\rho v^2/2}\n",

    "where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient (a dimensionless quantity\n",
    "dependent on the shape of the object), $A$ is a reference area\n",
