<p>
CP213 runs over two semesters.  The lecturers for this module will be
myself and Abdul Sharif.  I will be delivering the lectures and
tutorials in the first semester, and Abdul will deliver the lectures
in the next semester.  Matthew Lenaghan and Thomas Paterson will be
your demonstrators.
</p>

<p>
The module will be delivered through a series of lectures, question &amp;
answer sessions, and tutorial workshops.  These will be accompanied by
short videos and worksheets.
</p>

<p>
The links for each of these activities can be found on the Myplace
site for the module.
</p>

<p>
The Monday sessions, which start at 10.00 am, will be mainly to deliver
lectures of new material, while the Wednesday sessions, which start at
12.00 pm, will be mainly be devoted to answering any questions from
the tutorial session or any other material that you may have regarding
the course.  Both these sessions will last roughly an hour.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each week, you will be given a tutorial sheet.
Tutorial sessions will be held on Tuesdays from 3.00 to 5.00 pm to
give you an opportunity to work in groups on the tutorial problems, as
well as get help from the demonstrators and the lecturers.
</p>

<p>
You should start to attempt the tutorial questions before these
sessions.  You will be expected to upload your individual solutions to
these problems on Myplace on the Monday.  Fully worked model solutions
will be provided in the following week.
</p>

<p>
In the final week of the semester, all scheduled sessions
will be used to review the module contents as well as address any
questions you may have on this or any other second year modules on the
course.

</p>

<p>
So, let's open with the "important stuff": the assessment of the
module or how you get marks.  
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, the most important thing about this module, or any of
the modules that you will take on this course, is what you learn from
them; however, I don't want to downplay the importance of getting good
marks.
</p>

<p>
There are two components of assessment for this module: a class test,
worth 20% of the overall module mark, to be held in week 11 of
semester 1, and an exam, worth 80% of the module mark, to be held in
the semester 2 examination period.
</p>

<p>
The class test will be held on Tuesday December 03, and start at 3.00
pm.  It will replace the normally scheduled tutorial workshop.  The
test will last one hour, and it will be completely open notes and open
internet.  The test will take place in this computer room and the one
next door, and you will have to be here in-person.  The main
restrictions are that you will not be able to use software or on-line
resources that everyone else does not have access to.  That is, you
should not use pay-sites or software that you have bought.  Also, for
fairness, you will not be able to use your own laptops, tablets, or
phones on the during the test.  The only computer you can use is the
desktop computer that you are assigned here.  In addition, you will
not be allowed to communicate with anyone during the test or use any
software to communicate with anyone.
</p>

<p>
More details will be provided later in the semester.
</p>

<p>
The exam will be held in the semester 2 examination period.  It will
be two hours in duration.  It will have a similar format to the class
test, in that it will be held in these computer rooms and will be open
notes and open internet.  More details will be provided in the latter
half of semester 2.

</p>

<p>
The only way to learn things is by doing, and to learn mathematics and
problem solving you have to solve problems!  As a result, the module
will be driven by the tutorials.  Most of your learning will take
place as you are struggling with the tutorial questions.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial worksheets will be released at the beginning of the week.
I recommend you take a look at the questions and begin to attempt
answering them ahead of the Thursday Q&amp;A sessions, so that you can ask
any questions that you may have.  If you post your questions on the
Myplace forum ahead of the Thursday session, I may be able to prepare
materials ahead of time.
</p>

<p>
Your solutions to the tutorial questions should be submitted on
Myplace by midnight on Monday.  Even though you will be working in
groups to solve the tutorials, you should submit your own individual
solutions to the Myplace site.  On the following day, fully worked
model solutions will be released on Myplace.
</p>

<p>
As part of the process, you will be asked to evaluate and give
comments on two other students' tutorial solutions.  One purpose of
this is to give helpful comments to where students could improve their
work and they way it is documented.  The other purpose of this is to
ensure that you have looked at and understand the model solutions.
</p>


<p>
As mentioned previously, the lectures and Q&amp;A sessions will take place
on Mondays and Thursdays.  These will be hour-long, on-line Zoom
meetings where new material will be delivered and where you have a
chance to ask questions.
</p>


<p>
For most of you, a new aspect of this module will be Python
programming or programming in general.  The key aspect of programming
is that it allows you to solve repetitive tasks, such as sorting
lists and recognizing faces.
</p>

<p>
So far on the course, and in your education as a whole, you have
worked through a lot of problems, either following example worked
solutions or solving tutorial and coursework problems.  Most likely
you have solved these problems as "single one-offs".  That is you have
done the calculations by hand, and if you were asked resolve the
problem at a later time, you would have to perform the calculations
all over again.  Also, if you were asked the same question, but with
slightly changed starting numbers, you would still have to perform all
your calculations again.
</p>

<p>
A key benefit of programming is that it allows you to write a code to
solve these problems "once".  The code provides clear documentation of
what calculations you actually have done, and if you find a mistake,
you can simply fix the code and let the computer perform the
calculations again for you.  In addition, if you write your code more
generally, you can use it to solve a wide range of problems, without
any need to alter the code.  All you need to do is change the input.
</p>

<p>
Computers are not very smart, and being able to tell a computer how to
precisely solve a problem means you have really understood the
solution.  
</p>

<p>
By the end of this module, I hope that you will be able to have a set
of software tools that you have developed that will allow you to solve
a wide variety of chemical engineering problems, and that you will be
able to use these tools you have developed in your further career.

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
The learning objectives for this module can be divided into three main
areas. 
</p>

<p>
The first area that we will be covering is mathematics.  The biggest
challenge in mathematics is typically not the manipulation of
mathematical expressions or following methods for solving equations.
Rather it is understanding how to relate the mathematics to real world
problems.  Typically, the math problems that we find most difficult in
school are "word problems".  This because it is hard to recognize the
connection between elements of the abstract mathematics and their
concrete incarnations.
</p>

<p>
However, the problem solving in this class does not just relate to
academic mathematical problems.  It involves learning how and where to
find answers to your questions, which includes using search engines,
such as Google, or on-line forums, such as Stack Overflow, or other
learning resources, such as videos on YouTube.  
</p>

<p>
The other area we will be addressing is <b>mathematics</b>.  We will be
developing our ability to analyze and solve the mathematical models
that we develop.  Part of this will involve revising and reinforcing
your prior knowledge of mathematics, but we will also cover some new
material, including analytical and numerical methods for solving
equations.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we will be introducing you to programming, using Python.  At
the most basic level, it provides a more efficient way for you to do
computations that you would normally perform using your calculator;
however, it allows you easily repeat your calculations, as well as
provides a record of exactly how they were done.  However, programming
is much more powerful that this, and we will explore how it can be
used to provide solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be
solved analytically.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the main learning objective is <b>problem solving</b>, which in
this module will mainly involve formulating mathematical descriptions
of different engineering problems, discovering and learning tools that
will help you solve the equations that arise, and finally applying
those tools and interpreting the results.

Mathematics as using tools 
</p>

<p>
A lot of what you have been taught about math is within the frame if
operating a tool.  You gave been focused on learning how to dig holes
with a shovel.  Practicing digging ditches, filling holes, moving
soil, etc.  You have spent little time on why the heck you actually
want to have these holes, or why dirt needs to be moved from one place
to another.  Also, we are in an age where no one really use shovels
any more.  They now use excavators, drilling machines, etc.
</p>

<p>
As an engineer, especially as a chemical engineer, we do not
necessarily even know how to operate the equipment.  We are required
to know how these things can help us achieve our goal, which will be
at a higher, more abstract level.

<h2 id="org8de8879">Schedule for semester 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Weeks 1-2: Python and its applications</li>
<li>Weeks 3-5: Differential balances</li>
<li>Weeks 6-9: Ordinary differential equations</li>
<li>Week 10: Module review</li>
<li>Week 11: Class test</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">

</p>

<p>
The planned schedule for semester 1 is shown here.  It is formally
divided into four main sections.
</p>

<p>
In the first week, the programming language Python will be introduced.
Don't worry, as there is no expectation for you to have any prior
programming experience.  There will be no need to install any software
on your computer to do the programming exercises.  Everything will be
done through Jupyter notebooks, which will be accessible through your
web browser.
</p>


<p>
The next three weeks will devoted learning about differential
balances, which is essentially applying the concepts of mass and
energy balances that you were introduced to last year to systems that
are non-uniform or with properties that may vary in time.  
</p>

<p>
These differential balances will result in equations known as
differential equations, which relate variables, as well as their
derivatives to each other.  In weeks 5-8, we will learn methods for
solving these types of equations.
</p>

<p>
The last topic we will touch on is multivariate calculus, where we
will examine functions that depend on more than one independent
variable.  This will allow us to examine problems such as quantifying
the impact of uncertainty on our calculations, fitting model
parameters to experimental data, and the diffusion of mass or heat
through a material.
</p>

<p>
The penultimate week of the semester will be devoted to reviewing the
module materials.  A class test work 20% of the marks in the module
will be held on the Wednesday of week 11.

<p>
In addition to the materials that you will be provided in the module,
there are a wealth of resources that you can freely access from the
library and on the internet.
</p>

<p>
A couple of recommended books which are on the reading list are
Stroud, Engineering Mathematics, which is an excellent text book that
covers the mathematical material we will use in this module, and
Hetland, Beginning Python: From novice to professional, which is a
good reference for learning the basics of Python.
</p>

<p>
Some on-line channels that contain videos that you may find helpful,
are LearnChemE, which provides a bunch of lectures and worked examples
on various topics in chemical engineering, developed by the University
of Colorado, and 3Blue1Brown, Professor Leonard, and Eddie Woo, which
are very nice YouTube channels with lectures on different aspects of
mathematics.
</p>

<p>
These are just a few suggestions.  If you come across any additional
resources that you find helpful, please share them by posting in the
class forum on Myplace.
