<p>
CP213 runs over two semesters.  The lectures for this module will be
myself and Abdul Sharif.  Chris Boyle , Umair Jamal, and Tom Stavert
will be your demonstrators.
</p>

<p>
The module will be delivered through a series of live lectures,
question &amp; answer sessions, and tutorial workshops.  These will be
delivered via Zoom in the first weeks of the semester, and possibly
transition to face-to-face sessions later in the semester, depending
on the circumstances.  The links for each of these activities can be
found on the Myplace site for the module.
</p>

<p>
The Monday sessions, which start at 10.00 am, will be mainly to
deliver lectures of new material, while the Thursday sessions, which
start at 1.00 pm, will be mainly be devoted to answering any questions
that you may have regarding the course.  Both these sessions will last
roughly an hour.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each week, you will be given a tutorial sheet.
Tutorial sessions will be held on Fridays from 3.00 to 5.00 to give
you an opportunity to work in groups on the tutorial problems, as well
as get help from the demonstrators and the lecturers.  
</p>

<p>
You should start to attempt the tutorial questions before these
sessions.  You will be expected to upload your individual solutions to
these problems on Myplace on the Monday.  Fully worked model solutions
will be provided in the following week.
</p>

<p>
In the final week of the semester, all scheduled sessions
will be used to review the module contents as well as address any
questions you may have on this or any other second year modules on the
course.

There are two components of assessment for this module: 
</p>

<p>
a class test, worth 20% of the overall module mark,
to be held in week 10 of semester 1.
</p>

<p>
and an exam, worth 80% of the module mark, to be held in the semester 2
examination period.
</p>

<p>
The class test will be held on Friday November 27 and start at 3.00
pm.  It will replace the normally scheduled tutorial workshop.  The
test will last one hour, and more details will be provided later in
the semester.

<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Programming with Python</li>

</p>

<p>
The learning objectives for this module can be divided into three main
areas. 
</p>

<p>
The first area is <b>problem solving</b>, which in this module will mainly
involve formulating mathematical descriptions of different engineering
problems.
</p>

<p>
The biggest challenge in mathematics is typically not the manipulation
of mathematical expressions or following methods for solving
equations.  Rather it is understanding how to relate the mathematics
to real world problems.  Typically, the math problems that we find
most difficult in school are "word problems".  This because it is hard
to recognize the connection between elements of the abstract mathematics
and their concrete incarnations.
</p>


<p>
The other area we will be addressing is <b>mathematics</b>.  We will be
developing our ability to analyze and solve the mathematical models
that we develop.  Part of this will involve revising and reinforcing
your prior knowledge of mathematics, but we will also cover some new
material, including analytical and numerical methods for solving
 equations.
</p>



<p>
Finally, we will be introducing you to programming, using Python.  At
the most basic level, it provides a more efficient way for you to do
computations that you would normally perform using your calculator;
however, it allows you easily repeat your calculations, as well as
provides a record of exactly how they were done.  However, programming
is much more powerful that this, and we will explore how it can be
used to provide solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be
solved analytically.
</p>






<p>
The ability
to program&#x2026; document your calculations
</p>

<p>
which will be analyzing the mathematical models we develop
and analyzing their behavior.  
</p>

<p>
how can we formulate the mathematical equations that describe the
physical system.
</p>


<p>
For example, we might have an exothermic chemical reaction going on in
a vessel that needs
</p>

<p>
developing problems solving skills
</p>


<p>
how to relate any
</p>


<p>
and learning some new mathematical concepts and
techniques, and using Python.
</p>




<p>
Mathematics:
</p>

<p>
This module will review and use concepts in calculus in a deeper
manner.  
</p>

<p>
ordinary differential equations,
analytical and numerical methods for their solution,
multivariate calculus, calculus applied to functions of several variables.
</p>

<p>
In the second semester, this will include
</p>


<p>
linear algebra, which involves a better understanding of the abstract
notion of vector spaces and their applications, 
</p>


<p>
Python programming:

<p>
The planned schedule for semester 1 is shown here.  It is formally
divided into four main sections.
</p>

<p>
In the first week, the programming language Python will be introduced.
Don't worry, as there is no expectation for you to have any prior
programming experience.  There will be no need to install any software
on your computer to do the programming exercises.  Everything will be
done through Jupyter notebooks, which will be accessible through your
web browser.
</p>


<p>
The next three weeks will devoted learning about differential
balances, which is essentially applying the concepts of mass and
energy balances that you were introduced to last year to systems that
are non-uniform or with properties that may vary in time.  
</p>

<p>
These differential balances will result in equations known as
differential equations, which relate variables, as well as their
derivatives to each other.  In weeks 5-8, we will learn methods for
solving these types of equations.
</p>

<p>
The last topic we will touch on is multivariate calculus, where we
will examine functions that depend on more than one independent
variable.  This will allow us to examine problems such as quantifying
the impact of uncertainty on our calculations, fitting model
parameters to experimental data, and the diffusion of mass or heat
through a material.
</p>

<p>
The final week of the semester will be devoted to reviewing the module
materials.

In addition to the materials that you will be provided in the module,
there are a wealth of resources that you can freely access from the
library and on the internet.
</p>

<p>
A couple of recommended books which are on the reading list are
Stroud, Engineering Mathematics, which is an excellent text book that
covers the mathematical material we will use in this module, and
Hetland, Beginning Python: From novice to professional, which is a
good reference for learning the basics of Python.
</p>

<p>
Some on-line channels that contain videos that you may find helpful,
are LearnChemE, which provides a bunch of lectures and worked examples
on various topics in chemical engineering, developed by the University
of Colorado, and 3Blue1Brown, Professor Leonard, and Eddie Woo, which
are very nice YouTube channels with lectures on different aspects of
mathematics.
</p>

<p>
These are just a few suggestions.  If you come across any additional
resources that you find helpful, please share them by posting in the
class forum on Myplace.
