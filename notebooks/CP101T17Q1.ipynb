    "The element balances given above provide four equations which can be solved to determine the four unknowns: $A$, $B$, $C$, and $F_{\\rm H_2O}$.  However, performing the algebra by hand is rather tedious.  Instead, we can use Python to solve these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to develop a function that will return the value of the left side of each of the element balances.  At the exact values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $F_{\\rm H_2O}$, these will be zero, however, for general values of these variables, the left sides of these balances will be non-zero.  The function `acc` takes in the list `x` and unpacks it into the variables `A`, `B`, `C`, and `H2O_out` (which is $F_{\\rm H_2O}$).   Note that the order in which we unpack the variables does not matter, however, it dictates the order in which the `fsolve` will report the solution to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then returns a list `res` which has items that are the \"mismatches\" of the element balances.  Note that in the way we have packed the list `res`, `res[0]` is the nitrogen balance, `res[1]` is the carbon balance, `res[2]` is the oxygen balance, and `res[3]` is the hydrogen balance.  The order of these items, however, does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the function `fsolve` to solve the element balances, we need to supply an initial guess. "
