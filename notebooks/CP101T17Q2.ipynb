First, we note that there are only two independent element balance equations, as two of the balances can be derived from the other two.  So, rather than looping over all elements in the system, we only loop through nitrogen and carbon.  Next, we need to change how we unpack the variable `x` that `fsolve` passes to the function.  In this case, this is just the flow rates of streams $A$ and $B$.  The function is given below:\n"
